## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- MySQL

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/quiz-app.git
    ```

2. **Backend Setup:**

    - Navigate to the `backend` directory:
      ```bash
      cd online-quiz-app-backend
      ```

    - Install dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

    - Create a `.env` file and configure your database connection:
      ```
      DB_HOST=localhost
      DB_USER=root
      DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
      DB_NAME=quiz_app
      ```

    - Create the necessary tables in your MySQL database. Hereâ€™s a basic table schema:

      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE quizzes (
          id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
          title VARCHAR(255),
          questions JSON
      );

      CREATE TABLE results (
          id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
          quiz_id INT,
          user_name VARCHAR(255),
          score INT,
          FOREIGN KEY (quiz_id) REFERENCES quizzes(id)
      );
      ```

    - Run the server:
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**

    - Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
      ```bash
      cd online-quiz-app-frontend
      ```

    - Install dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

    - Run the development server:
      ```bash

    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
